## The Engine Programming Server's List of Game-Playing Engines
### Chess Engines
| Engine Name | Author | Game(s) | CCRL 40/15 | Notes |
|-------------|--------|------|----------|-------|
| [Seer](https://github.com/connormcmonigle/seer-nnue) | [Connor McMonigle](https://github.com/connormcmonigle) | Chess | 3406 | Very strong engine, with NNUE trained via retrograde learning on tablebase positions. |
| [Smallbrain](https://github.com/Disservin/Smallbrain) | [Disservin](https://github.com/Disservin) | Chess | 3311 | Supports FRC & uses self-generated NNUE data. |
| [BlackCore](https://github.com/SzilBalazs/BlackCore) | [Szil](https://github.com/SzilBalazs) | Chess | 3307 | Very strong NNUE implementation. |
| [Alexandria](https://github.com/PGG106/Alexandria) | [Zuppa D. Cipolle](https://github.com/PGG106) | Chess | 3261 | Strong C engine with VICE ancestry. |
| [Viridithas](https://github.com/cosmobobak/viridithas) | [Cosmo Bobak](https://github.com/cosmobobak) | Chess | 3246 | Includes the Lichess Elite Database in his NNUE training data, considered a very aggressive engine by the [EAS Ratinglist](https://www.sp-cc.de/eas-ratinglist.html). |
| [Frozenight](https://github.com/MinusKelvin/frozenight) | [MinusKelvin](https://github.com/MinusKelvin) | Chess | 3226 | NNUE chess engine that never had an HCE, learned to play chess from zero knowledge. |
| [Weiss](https://github.com/TerjeKir/weiss) | [Terje](https://github.com/TerjeKir) | Chess | 3211 | A very strong VICE descendant, and one of the strongest HCE engines. |
| [Stash](https://gitlab.com/mhouppin/stash-bot) | [Morgan Houppin](https://gitlab.com/mhouppin) | Chess | 3211 | Another very strong HCE engine. Doesn't support tablebases. |
| [ice4](https://github.com/MinusKelvin/ice4) | [Minuskelvin](https://github.com/MinusKelvin) & [Analog Hors](https://github.com/analog-hors) | Chess | ~2800 | ice4 is a chess engine which fits in 4096 bytes. Written to take part in the TCEC's 4K tournament: https://wiki.chessdom.org/TCEC_4k_Rules |
| [4ku](https://github.com/kz04px/4ku) | [kz04px](https://github.com/kz04px), [Gedas](https://github.com/GediminasMasaitis), [Gian-Carlo Pascutto](https://github.com/gcp), and [others](https://github.com/kz04px/4ku/graphs/contributors) | Chess | 2690 | A UCI chess engine in 4 kB. The 4ku-mini script contains compressed C++ source code, that is extracted and compiled before being run. Written to take part in the TCEC's 4K tournament: https://wiki.chessdom.org/TCEC_4k_Rules |
| [Svart](https://github.com/crippa1337/svart) | [Crippa](https://github.com/crippa1337) | Chess | ~2400 | Written in Rust! |
| [Valiant](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tfiwhx900g4ni42/AABEm29llAn1MaG8D6yW8ZO7a?dl=0) | [Enderjed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1lxAkP5jGVBUIWdz3WIhSg) | Chess | est. 1200-2100 | Mk V has a startup sound, Mk 3.2 "Archer" has reversed piece square tables, Mk 2 "Valentine" barely cares about king safety, Mk2 and Mk3's sources are lost to time... It's greatest anomaly is being able to consistently beat BBC 1.4 (with Stockfish NNUE!) |
| [Mess](https://github.com/raklaptudirm/mess) | [Rak Laptudirm](https://github.com/raklaptudirm) | Chess | ??? | Written in Go! |
| [Willow](https://github.com/Adam-Kulju/Willow) | [Adam Kulju](https://github.com/Adam-Kulju) | Chess | ??? | Hung a queen in its second-ever tournament game! |
| [Honse](https://github.com/EngineProgramming/honse) | [The Engine Programming Discord](https://discord.com/invite/YctB2p4) | Chess | ??? | A public didactic engine open for anyone in the server to contribute to. Rust, Alpha-Beta, classical evaluation, maybe NNUE in the future. |
